# Key Smart Badge tracker commands

There is major difference in the Smart Badge commands from MCU Firmware 2.3 and the ones below. The first step is to find out the MCU Firmware version of the tracker.

## Find the MCU firmware version of the tracker

The button sequence to reset the tracker is quite different between Asset Tracker MCU Firmware 2.3 and the versions below. The first step is to find out the installed MCU firmware version of the tracker from [here](../../D-Reference/IdentifyInstalledFirmware/).

## The tracker commands for MCU Firmware 2.3 and above

This table gives you quick access to the tracker commands. For more information on all the commands and LED patterns, see [Abeeway Trackers Reference Guide: User Interfaces](../../abeeway-trackers-reference-guide/AbeewayRefGuide/functioning/user-interfaces).



:::warning Important
* **Click:** Press the button **less than one second**.
* **Press:** Press the button **between** lasts **1 and 4 seconds**.
* **Long Press:** Press the button **between** lasts **5 and 7 seconds**.
* **Double-click:** Press the button 2 times (The duration **between** the clicks is **less than 1 second**).
* **Triple-click:** Press the button 3 times (The duration **between** the clicks is **less than 1 second**).
* **Very Long Press or ESC Sequence:** Press the button **more than 14 seconds**. The tracker will play a beep every second during this time.
* **Since MCU Firmware 2.3+**, the button sequence is configurable with **button_mapping** parameter. The examples below are for the button mapping for the default firmware configuration. For more inforation, visit [User Interface training](https://actilitysa.sharepoint.com/:f:/t/aby/EiWIqYpAehBKg3Py8I6X07oBFFxUWT3i2FVHYRX2MzXtow?e=ZFkhrM).
* Please ensure you refer to the [Abeeway Trackers Reference Guide](../../AbeewayRefGuide/introduction/) that matches your MCU Firmware version. **The user interface of Abeeway trackers have different behavior across different MCU Firmware versions.**
* The sequences below are the same for micro tracker and smart badge.
* Abeeway trackers have three important states:
   1. **SHIPPING:** This is usually the state when the tracker leaves the warehouse. The tracker is in lower power state waiting to be activated with a **button Press (between 1 and 4 seconds)**. Once, activated, the tracker moves to JOINING state.
   2. **JOINING:** In this state, the tracker is trying to join the LoRaWAN network, but has not joined yet. Each **button press (between 1 and 4 seconds)** in this state restarts the join procedure and also activates the Bluetooth of the tracker to allow pairing with the Abeeway tracking app. If the Bluetooth is successfully activated, the tracker will play [Bluetooth advertisement melody](https://actilitysa.sharepoint.com/:u:/t/aby/EWdjoLPV12BGiHsZptjIOrABxRdVpqTLLJM72K795IUQsg?e=kcW1U3) for about 10 minutes (which is the default configuration). The Micro tracker/Smart Badge will make 15 LoRaWAN join attempts for EU region and 27 attempts for other regions. If the join is not successful after these attempts, tracker will go back to SHIPPING state and needs to be re-activated again with the **button Press (between 1 and 4 seconds)**.
   3. **JOINED:** In this state, the tracker has successfully joined the LoRaWAN network and is functioning normally.

## The tracker commands for MCU Firmware 2.2 and below

This table gives you quick access to the tracker commands. For more information on all the commands and LED patterns, see [Abeeway Trackers Reference Guide](../../AbeewayRefGuide/functioning/user-interfaces/).

:::warning Important
* **Click:** Press the button **less than one second**.
* **Long Press:** Press the button **more than five seconds**.
* **Double-click:** Press the button 2 times (The duration **between** the clicks is **less than 1 second**).
* **Triple-click:** Press the button 3 times (The duration **between** the clicks is **less than 1 second**).
* Please ensure you refer to the [Abeeway Trackers Reference Guide](../../AbeewayRefGuide/introduction/) that matches your MCU Firmware version. **The user interface of Abeeway trackers have different behavior across different MCU Firmware versions.**
* The sequences below are the same for micro tracker and smart badge.
* Abeeway trackers have three important states:
   1. **SHIPPING:** This is usually the state when the tracker leaves the warehouse. The tracker is in lower power state waiting to be activated with a **Long Press (more than 5 seconds)**. Once, activated, the tracker moves to JOINING state.
   2. **JOINING:** In this state, the tracker is trying to join the LoRaWAN network, but has not joined yet. Each **long press (more than 5 seconds)** in this state restarts the join procedure and also activates the Bluetooth of the tracker to allow pairing with the Abeeway tracking app. If the Bluetooth is successfully activated, the tracker will play [Bluetooth advertisement melody](https://actilitysa.sharepoint.com/:u:/t/aby/EWdjoLPV12BGiHsZptjIOrABxRdVpqTLLJM72K795IUQsg?e=kcW1U3) for about 10 minutes (which is the default configuration). The Micro tracker/Smart Badge will make 15 LoRaWAN join attempts for EU region and 27 attempts for other regions. If the join is not successful after these attempts, tracker will go back to SHIPPING state and needs to be re-activated again with a **long press (more than 5 seconds)**. 
   3. **JOINED:** In this state, the tracker has successfully joined the LoRaWAN network and is functioning normally.
