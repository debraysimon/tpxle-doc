# Downlink messages

These messages are sent from the server to the tracker through the  
LoRaWAN™ network. They are used to either configure or manage the  
tracker. Each message contains a header including:

- A message type
- An acknowledgement token

The remaining of the message depends on the message type described in  
the following table.

:::tip Notes
1.  Any unexpected message (unknown message type, bad length, etc) is discarded. However, the ack token is updated even if the message is discarded (if the payload is at least 2 bytes long).
2.  The **LoRaWAN™** port to be used for sending downlink is **2**.
