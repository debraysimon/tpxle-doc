# Event message

| Common header              | Data            | Data                |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Byte 0-4                   | Byte 5          | Byte 6-12           |
| Header with **Type**\=0x0A | **Event Value** | **Additional data** |

It notifies generic events.

## Event Value

-   0x00: **geolocation start** message: If activated (bit 6 of *config_flags* set), the event message is sent when the tracker begins a geolocation.
-   0x01: **motion_start** message: If activated (bit 8 of *config_flags* set), the event message is sent when the tracker begins a motion.
-   0x02: **motion_end** message: If activated (bit 9 of *config_flags* set), the event message is sent when the end. of a motion is detected.
-   0x03: **BLE connected**: Sent when a tracker is bonded and BLE connected to a mobile or a tablet
-   0x04: **BLE disconnected**: Sent when a tracker is bonded and BLE disconnected to a mobile or a tablet
-   0x05: **Temperature information** message: if the temperature monitoring is activated (the parameter *temperature_high* or *temperature_low* is set), this event message is sent when there is a state change in the temperature (normal to alert or alert to normal) or it can be sent instead of a geolocation message if the geolocation is cancelled due to *temperature_action* parameter. (Refer to the section [Temperature monitoring](../../functioning/temperature-monitoring/readme.md) for more details)
-   0x06: **BLE bond deleted**: Sent when the bond is deleted on the tracker (it is sent even if the tracker was not bonded before the command to remove BLE bond was sent to the tracker)
-   0x07: **SOS start** message: The tracker enters in SOS
-   0x08: **SOS stop** message: The tracker leaves the SOS
-   0x09: **Angle detection** event
-   0x0A: **BLE geozoning** event

## Additional data

### Motion_end message:

Provide the gravity vector, which can be used for the device  
orientation. Vector components can be negative.

**State:**

- 0: Normal temperature
- 1: High temperature
- 2: Low temperature
- 3: Feature not activated

**Max Temperature**: Maximum temperature measured by the device.

**Min Temperature**: Minimum temperature measured by the device.

**High counter**: From the time a high temperature event is sent, this counter is incremented every 10 minutes (can be used to calculate the over temperature time).

**Low counter**: From the time a low temperature event is sent, this counter is incremented every 10 minutes (can be used to calculate the under temperature time).

:::tip Notes

If the feature is not activated, values in the additional data part are not valid.

The counters never reset.

## BLE Connection messages:

These messages are sent when the tracker is interacting over Bluetooth with the [Abeeway tracking app](/C-Procedure-Topics/GetStartedMobileApp_T/) installed on the smart phone.
