# Extended position messages

 The extended position messages are sent if the bit 18 of the *config_flags* parameter is set, otherwise these payloads are only used in angle detection feature.

 All these position messages contain the age of the position in byte 5 and 6.

|Common header|Common header|Common header|Position information data|Position information data|
|------------|----------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Byte 0     |  Byte 1-3      |  Byte 4   |  Bytes 5-6     | <sup>(1)</sup>       |
|**Type**=0x0E|**Status/Batt/Temp.**|**ACK/OPT**|**Age** |**Extended Position data** |

 **Age**: Time difference between the fix and the LoRaWAN
 transmission. It is **expressed in seconds**. The value is in big
 endian (MSB first).

:::tip Note
<sup>(1)</sup> The size of data part depends on the type of position message.

 **BSSIDx**: BSSID of the WIFI station x.

 **RSSIx**: Receive Signal Strength Indication of the WIFI station x. Non encoded form (negative value, refer to the section [Two's complement Encoding](../../downlink-messages/two-complement-encoding/readme.md) for information for the encoding). It is expressed in dBm.

 When long WIFI payload is activated in *config_flags* parameter and transmit strategy is not well chosen, too long payload could not be transmitted. In this case, after 5 discarded uplinks, the tracker sends an **uplink length error** message which is described [here](../debug-payloads/readme.md).

:::tip Notes
1.  The payload contains the listened WIFI stations (up to 12 if bit 12 of *config_flags* parameter is set, up to 4 if it is reset).
2.  If less than 4 stations are listened to, the payload will be reduced.
3.  BSSID address is provided in big endian format. So, byte 6 of the payload contains the MSB of the BSSID0, while byte 11 contains its LSB.
4.  The data rate and the transmit strategy must be adapted to the payload size, or the payload will be rejected by the LoRaWANâ„¢ MAC, and won't be sent. Refer to the application note [AN- 002_LoRa_Transmission_strategy](../../../../documentation-library/abeeway-trackers#application-notes) for more details.
