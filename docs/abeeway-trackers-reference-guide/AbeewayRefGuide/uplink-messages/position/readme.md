|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|---------------- |
| **Age**     |**Latitude**|**Longitude**|**EHPE**  |**Encrypted**    |

**Age**: Time difference between the fix and the LoRaWAN transmission. [Encoded form](../encoded-form/readme.md) using **lo**= 0, **hi**=2040, **nbits**= 8, **resv**= 0. Expressed in seconds. The step is 8 seconds.

**Latitude**: Latitude of the position (expressed in degrees) is calculated as follows: 

Latitude = Latitude \&lt;\&lt; 8

If Latitude \&gt; 0x7FFFFFFF then Latitude = Latitude - 0x100000000

Latitude = Latitude / 10<sup>7</sup>

**Longitude**: Longitude of the position (expressed in degrees) is calculated as follow: 

Longitude = Longitude \&lt;\&lt; 8

If Longitude \&gt; 0x7FFFFFFF then Longitude = Longitude - 0x100000000

Longitude = Longitude / 10<sup>7</sup>

**EHPE**: Estimated Horizontal Position Error, expressed in meters. [Encoded form](/AbeewayRefGuide/uplink-messages/encoded-form/readme.md) using **lo**= 0, **hi**= 1000, **nbits**= 8, **nresv**= 0. The step is 3.9 meters.

:::tip Notes
1.  Most of time a WIFI timeout occurs due to a low battery condition.
2.  **V_bat** encoding uses: **lo**= 2.8, **hi**=4.2, **nbits**=8, **nresv**= 2. It is expressed in volt with a step of 5.5mV

## WIFI BSSID payload

 Common header with **Type**=0x03 and **Opt**=0x9
 **Position information data**
| Byte5      |  Bytes 6-11    |  Byte2    |  Bytes 13-18   | Byte19    |  Bytes 20-25 | Byte26 | Bytes 27-32| Byte33 |
|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Age**  |**BSSID0**  |**RSSI0**  |**BSSID1** |**RSSI1** |**BSSID2**|**RSSI2**|**BSSID3**|**RSSI3**|

 **Age**: [Encoded form](/AbeewayRefGuide/uplink-messages/encoded-form/readme.md) of scan age with **lo**=0, **hi**=2040, **nbits**=8, **nres**=0. Expressed in seconds. The step is 8 seconds.

 **BSSIDx**: BSSID of the WIFI station x.

 **RSSIx**: Receive Signal Strength Indication of the WIFI station x. Non encoded form (negative value, refer to the section [Two's complement Encoding](/AbeewayRefGuide/downlink-messages/two-complement-encoding/readme.md) for information for the encoding). It is expressed in dBm.

 When long WIFI payload is activated in *config_flags* parameter and transmit strategy is not well chosen, too long payload could not be transmitted. In this case, after 5 discarded uplinks, the tracker sends an **uplink length error** message which is described [here](/AbeewayRefGuide/uplink-messages/debug-payloads/readme.md)

:::tip Notes
1.  The payload contains the listened WIFI stations (up to 12 if bit 12 of *config_flags* parameter is set, up to 4 if it is reset).
2.  If less than 4 stations are listened, the payload will be reduced.
3.  BSSID address is provided in big endian format. So, the byte 6 of the payload contains the MSB of the BSSID0, while the byte 11 contains its LSB.
4.  The data rate and the transmit strategy must be adapted to the payload size, or the payload will be rejected by the LoRaWANâ„¢ MAC, and won't be sent. Refer to the application note [AN- 002_LoRa_Transmission_strategy](../../../../documentation-library/AbeewayTrackers_R.md#application-notes) for more data.
