designed to resist harsh surroundings enabling you to
perform seamless asset tracking in any industrial environment
for heavy-duty assets or small equipment, taking advantage
of its long battery autonomy. 

# Applications

- On-Demand, real-time and motion triggered tracking of assets, vehicles or livestock, indoor and outdoor.
- Monitoring of equipment sets through BLE detection around the tracker.
- Activity monitoring based on motion or vibration for usage optimization.
- Optimization of supply chain and production, delivery and inventory tracking.
- Geofencing and antitheft applications.
- Optional external temperature probe 


The Abeeway compact tracker is a multi-mode tracker that uses 3 replaceable AA format batteries for long battery lifetime and easy replacement. It combines **GPS**, **Low Power-GPS (LP-GPS)** ([an ultra-low power assisted GPS patented by Abeeway](https://www.abeeway.com/technology/) that also optimizes Time-to-First Fix in difficult conditions), **Wi-Fi**, **LoRaWAN®** and **BLE** radios with embedded sensors to support accurate **outdoor** and **indoor** geolocation.
