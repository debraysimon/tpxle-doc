# Provisioning your trackers on a third-party network server
This task consists of configuring your trackers in your third party network server to forward all packets to and from the Network Interface Converter that you have deployed in [Integrating a third-party network server](../../../../getting-started/provisioning-your-trackers-on-lorawan-networks/provisioning-your-trackers-on-third-party-network-servers/index.md#integrating-a-third-party-network-server).
## Creating an application
Using your network server interface, you need to create an application and add the Network Interface Converter application server you have created.<br/>
Our example is specific to TTN network server. Adapt it if using another network server.

1. Login in to your TTN console, and click **Add Application**.
