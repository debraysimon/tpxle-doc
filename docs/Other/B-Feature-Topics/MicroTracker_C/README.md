## Key product features
Abeeway micro tracker provides you with the flexibility you need to adapt your tracker's behavior to your use case, selecting the right operating mode and geolocation technology.

### Multiple operating modes

* **Motion tracking** : Tracker reports real-time position only when motion is detected. This is the default configuration that you can discover in this guide.
* **Permanent tracking** : Tracker reports periodic real time positions.
* **Start/End motion tracking** : Tracker reports positions only at the start and end events of the motion.
* **Position on-demand** : Tracker sends its position only when requested from the end-user (very low power operating mode). The position request can be made from the geolocation backend platform or by using special button sequence on the micro-tracker.
* **Activity tracking** : Monitor activity rate with embedded sensors.
* **OFF** : Tracker is switched off.

### Geolocation technologies

* **GPS** : For **precise outdoor** positioning
* **Low Power-GPS (LP-GPS)** : For **power-efficient outdoor** and **daylight indoor** positioning
LP-GPS is an Abeeway proprietary technology based on GPS. Enabling Fast Time to First Fix, it results in **improved battery lifetime**.
* **Wi-Fi** : For **indoor** and **outdoor** location services in **urban areas**
It leverages the Wi-Fi access point scanning capabilities of the micro tracker.
* **BLE** : For **indoor** positioning, it leverages Bluetooth scanning capabilities of the micro tracker to send BLE beacons and their detected RSSIs to your application.
