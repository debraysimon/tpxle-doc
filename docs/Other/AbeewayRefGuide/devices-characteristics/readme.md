In most cases, features using BLE can be used in parallel. However, there are features which should not be used be used simultaneously.

:::tip Notes

1.	While the tracker is BLE connected with Abeeway Mobile app, none of the above features are available.
2.	If too many features are used in parallel this can lead to a delay in the LoRa transmission due to dwell time/duty cycle restrictions. The periodicity and the length of the payloads generated by the tracker need to be studied to ensure that it is adequate for LoRa technology. Please refer to application note [AN-002_LoRa_Transmission_strategy](../../../D-Reference/DocLibrary_R/AbeewayTrackers_R.md#application-notes) on how to configure the tracker transmission strategy. It is also important that the LoRaWAN network is deployed to accommodate the traffic generated by the trackers.
