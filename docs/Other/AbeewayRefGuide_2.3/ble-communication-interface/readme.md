# BLE communication interface

The MCU applicative firmware uses the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capabilities of the trackers to interface with BLE devices, such as smart phones, for the following use cases:
-   Controlling the micro tracker via a mobile application
-   Managing the tracker (configuration and firmware update)

 Advertising can be managed using different parameters/actions depending on the tracker usage.
