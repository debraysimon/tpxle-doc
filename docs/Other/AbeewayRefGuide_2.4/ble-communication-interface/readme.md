# BLE communication interface

The MCU applicative firmware uses the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capabilities of the trackers to interface with BLE devices, such as smart phones, for the following use cases:
-   Using the Abeeway tracker via [Abeeway tracking application](/C-Procedure-Topics/GetStartedMobileApp_T/) to track pets, keys, people, etc.
-   Managing the tracker ([configuration and firmware update](/D-Reference/FirmwareUpdateMobileApp_R/))

Bluetooth Advertising period can be managed using different parameters/actions depending on the tracker usage.
